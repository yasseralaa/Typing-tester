Games and sports include all outdoor and indoor games and also athletics. In ancient Greece they formed the principal part of education. In the advanced countries of the present day also they are a regular feature of the school and college curriculum.Games and sports may be of various kinds. Apart from school or college sports, boys and girls may practice races, jumps, discuss throw and javelin throw and thus pass their afternoon in useful activities. They may play various games like football, cricket, hockey, volleyball, basket ball, badminton etc. School and College Games and sports are annual affairs. Sports are generally held in winter months. Students take part in various games like high and long jumps, pole vault, go-as-you like and different kind of races. These annual sports foster competitive spirit and sportsmanship. Sometimes inter class tournaments are held in relation with football, hockey, cricket, tennis, cycling, volleyball, badminton etc. These games foster team spirit among the participants and make them disciplined.For these reasons, every civilized nation values the importance of games and sports and spends large sum of money on improving the standard of games and sports among its players and athletes. The standard of games and sports in India is far from satisfactory. So, the Government should take steps to improve this standard.First of all, they are good exercises and help to build fine, physique for the boys and girls. They make them mentally alert and physically strong.Secondly, students learn to cope with difficult situations. By displaying their feats before many spectators, they can overcome their nervousness.Thirdly, games and sports are good diversions and give them energy to learn their lessons well.Discipline means order or code of behaviour. Self-discipline refers to the ability to control one’s own feeling is very important. Self-Discipline leads to overcome one’s own weaknesses.Life without Self-discipline is no life. We need be guided by rules. We have to be respectful to our elders. We must obey our seniors.Self-Discipline is most needed for success in life. Discipline is a must whether we are at school or at a home. It is equally necessary whether we are in the office or on the playground. Our life, our society, our country or even the world will go astray without Discipline. So some sort of Discipline is required everywhere. There is order in Nature. Even small disorder in the world of Nature leads to chaos.";


            //string text = "Money is the most important and essential tool of modern economic life. One cannot imagine modern economic life without money. Barter economies or self-sufficient economies are the thing of past and historical significance. Money is the foundation stone of modern economic life. Money is the pivot around which all economic activities revolve. Money is important in all economies whether it is a socialist economy or a capitalist economy; or a backward economy or a rich economy. In the initial stages of exchange economy, commodities were exchanged with commodities. Such transactions were known as barter transactions. In this stage commodity was the form of money. How­ever, under barter transactions there were difficulties relating to common measure of value, store of value, divisibility of goods etc. Therefore, in place of commodities gold and silver were used as money. But even this system could not continue for long because the available stock of gold and silver was not adequate to meet the demand for the quantity of money. Therefore , it was replaced by paper money where promissory notes arc used as money. Now, besides paper money, credit money is being used exten­sively such as credit cards etc. There are many functions of money such as medium of exchange, basis of store of value, common measure of value, standard of deferred payments etc. However, money as a medium of exchange is the most important function. Therefore, in general, by money we mean such commodities which are ac­cepted as medium of exchange and which have legal sanction and general acceptability.";
