            string text = "In the late 1940's John von Neumann (at the time a special consultant to the ENIAC team) developed the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) which pioneered the stored program concept. This allowed programs to be read into the computer and so gave birth to the age of general-purpose computers.It used to be quite popular to refer to computers as belonging to one of several generations of computer. These generations are The First Generation (1943-1958): This generation is often described as starting with the delivery of the first commercial computer to a business client. This happened in 1951 with the delivery of the UNIVAC to the US Bureau of the Census. This generation lasted until about the end of the 1950's (although some stayed in operation much longer than that). The main defining feature of the first generation of computers was that vacuum tubes were used as internal computer components. Vacuum tubes are generally about 5-10 centimeters in length and the large numbers of them required in computers resulted in huge and extremely expensive machines that often broke down (as tubes failed). The Second Generation (1959-1964): In the mid-1950's Bell Labs developed the transistor. Transistors were capable of performing many of the same tasks as vacuum tubes but were only a fraction of the size. The first transistor-based computer was produced in 1959. Transistors were not only smaller, enabling computer size to be reduced, but they were faster, more reliable and consumed less electricity. The other main improvement of this period was the development of computer languages. Assembler languages or symbolic languages allowed programmers to specify instructions in words (albeit very cryptic words) which were then translated into a form that the machines could understand (typically series of 0's and 1's: Binary code). Higher level languages also came into being during this period. Whereas assembler languages had a one-to-one correspondence between their symbols and actual machine functions, higher level language commands often represent complex sequences of machine codes. Two higher-level languages developed during this period (Fortran and Cobol) are still in use today though in a much more developed form.The Third Generation (1965-1970): In 1965 the first integrated circuit (IC) was developed in which a complete circuit of hundreds of components were able to be placed on a single silicon chip 2 or 3 mm square. Computers using these IC's soon replaced transistor based machines. Again, one of the major advantages was size, with computers becoming more powerful and at the same time much smaller and cheaper. Computers thus became accessible to a much larger audience. An added advantage of smaller size is that electrical signals have much shorter distances to travel and so the speed of computers increased. ";


            //string text = "Money is the most important and essential tool of modern economic life. One cannot imagine modern economic life without money. Barter economies or self-sufficient economies are the thing of past and historical significance. Money is the foundation stone of modern economic life. Money is the pivot around which all economic activities revolve. Money is important in all economies whether it is a socialist economy or a capitalist economy; or a backward economy or a rich economy. In the initial stages of exchange economy, commodities were exchanged with commodities. Such transactions were known as barter transactions. In this stage commodity was the form of money. How­ever, under barter transactions there were difficulties relating to common measure of value, store of value, divisibility of goods etc. Therefore, in place of commodities gold and silver were used as money. But even this system could not continue for long because the available stock of gold and silver was not adequate to meet the demand for the quantity of money. Therefore , it was replaced by paper money where promissory notes arc used as money. Now, besides paper money, credit money is being used exten­sively such as credit cards etc. There are many functions of money such as medium of exchange, basis of store of value, common measure of value, standard of deferred payments etc. However, money as a medium of exchange is the most important function. Therefore, in general, by money we mean such commodities which are ac­cepted as medium of exchange and which have legal sanction and general acceptability.";
