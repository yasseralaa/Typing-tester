            string text = "The Third Generation (1965-1970): In 1965 the first integrated circuit (IC) was developed in which a complete circuit of hundreds of components were able to be placed on a single silicon chip 2 or 3 mm square. Computers using these IC's soon replaced transistor based machines. Again, one of the major advantages was size, with computers becoming more powerful and at the same time much smaller and cheaper. Computers thus became accessible to a much larger audience. An added advantage of smaller size is that electrical signals have much shorter distances to travel and so the speed of computers increased. Another feature of this period is that computer software became much more powerful and flexible and for the first time more than one program could share the computer's resources at the same time (multi-tasking). The majority of programming languages used today are often referred to as 3GL's (3rd generation languages) even though some of them originated during the 2nd generation.The Fourth Generation (1971-present): The boundary between the third and fourth generations is not very clear-cut at all. Most of the developments since the mid 1960's can be seen as part of a continuum of gradual miniaturisation. In 1970 large-scale integration was achieved where the equivalent of thousands of integrated circuits were crammed onto a single silicon chip. This development again increased computer performance (especially reliability and speed) whilst reducing computer size and cost. Around this time the first complete general-purpose microprocessor became available on a single chip. In 1975 Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) took the process one step further. Complete computer central processors could now be built into one chip. The microcomputer was born. Such chips are far more powerful than ENIAC and are only about 1cm square whilst ENIAC filled a large building.During this period Fourth Generation Languages (4GL's) have come into existence. Such languages are a step further removed from the computer hardware in that they use language much like natural language. Many database languages can be described as 4GL's. They are generally much easier to learn than are 3GL's.The Fifth Generation (the future): The fifth generation of computers were defined by the Japanese government in 1980 when they unveiled an optimistic ten-year plan to produce the next generation of computers. This was an interesting plan for two reasons. Firstly, it is not at all really clear what the fourth generation is, or even whether the third generation had finished yet. Secondly, it was an attempt to define a generation of computers before they had come into existence. The main requirements of the 5G machines was that they incorporate the features of Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems, and Natural Language. The goal was to produce machines that are capable of performing tasks in similar ways to humans, are capable of learning, and are capable of interacting with humans in natural language and preferably using both speech input (speech recognition) and speech output (speech synthesis). Such goals are obviously of interest to linguists and speech scientists as natural language and speech processing are key components of the definition. As you may have guessed, this goal has not yet been fully realised, although significant progress has been made towards various aspects of these goals.";


            //string text = "Money is the most important and essential tool of modern economic life. One cannot imagine modern economic life without money. Barter economies or self-sufficient economies are the thing of past and historical significance. Money is the foundation stone of modern economic life. Money is the pivot around which all economic activities revolve. Money is important in all economies whether it is a socialist economy or a capitalist economy; or a backward economy or a rich economy. In the initial stages of exchange economy, commodities were exchanged with commodities. Such transactions were known as barter transactions. In this stage commodity was the form of money. How­ever, under barter transactions there were difficulties relating to common measure of value, store of value, divisibility of goods etc. Therefore, in place of commodities gold and silver were used as money. But even this system could not continue for long because the available stock of gold and silver was not adequate to meet the demand for the quantity of money. Therefore , it was replaced by paper money where promissory notes arc used as money. Now, besides paper money, credit money is being used exten­sively such as credit cards etc. There are many functions of money such as medium of exchange, basis of store of value, common measure of value, standard of deferred payments etc. However, money as a medium of exchange is the most important function. Therefore, in general, by money we mean such commodities which are ac­cepted as medium of exchange and which have legal sanction and general acceptability.";
